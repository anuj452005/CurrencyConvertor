**Custom Hook: useCurrencyInfo

The useCurrencyInfo hook is a custom hook that fetches currency information from an external API. It takes a currency code as an argument and returns an object with the currency's exchange rate information.

Here's an example implementation of the useCurrencyInfo hook:

javascript
Edit
Copy code
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const useCurrencyInfo = (currencyCode) => {
  const [currencyInfo, setCurrencyInfo] = useState({});

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchCurrencyInfo = async () => {
      const response = await fetch(`https://api.exchangerate-api.com/v4/latest/${currencyCode}`);
      const data = await response.json();
      setCurrencyInfo(data);
    };
    fetchCurrencyInfo();
  }, [currencyCode]);

  return currencyInfo;
};

export default useCurrencyInfo;
In this implementation, the hook uses the useState hook to initialize an empty object currencyInfo. The useEffect hook is used to fetch the currency information from the API when the component mounts or when the currencyCode changes. The fetchCurrencyInfo function is called with the currencyCode as an argument, and the response data is set to the currencyInfo state using the setCurrencyInfo function.

Unified State Management

In your React application, you're using a unified state management approach by storing the application state in a single location, which is the App component.

Here's an overview of the state management in your application:

The App component has four state variables: amount, from, to, and convertedAmount.
The amount state variable stores the user-inputted amount.
The from and to state variables store the selected currencies.
The convertedAmount state variable stores the converted amount based on the selected currencies and exchange rates.
The state variables are updated using the useState hook, and the state is passed as props to the InputBox components.

Here's an example of how the state is updated in the App component:

javascript
Edit
Copy code
const App = () => {
  const [amount, setAmount] = useState(0);
  const [from, setFrom] = useState("usd");
  const [to, setTo] = useState("inr");
  const [convertedAmount, setConvertedAmount] = useState(0);

  const currencyInfo = useCurrencyInfo(from);

  const convert = () => {
    setConvertedAmount(amount * currencyInfo[to]);
  };

  // ...
};
In this example, the convert function updates the convertedAmount state variable by multiplying the amount state variable with the exchange rate from the currencyInfo object.

By using a unified state management approach, you can easily access and update the application state from any component in your application. This makes it easier to manage complex state changes and ensures that the application state is consistent across all components.

Custom Hooks
useCurrencyInfo
The useCurrencyInfo hook is used to fetch currency information from an external API. It takes a currency code as an argument and returns an object with the currency's exchange rate information.

Usage

javascript
Edit
Copy code
import useCurrencyInfo from './hooks/CustomHooks';

const currencyInfo = useCurrencyInfo('usd');
Unified State
The application uses a unified state management approach, where the state is stored in a single location, which is the App component. The state is updated using the useState hook, and the state is passed as props to the InputBox components.

State Variables

amount: The user-inputted amount.
from: The selected "From" currency.
to: The selected "To" currency.
convertedAmount: The converted amount based on the selected currencies and exchange rates.
State Updates

The state is updated using the useState hook, and the state is updated in response to user interactions, such as selecting a currency or entering an amount.

Props Passing

The state is passed as props to the InputBox components, which use the state to display the correct information to the user.

Here's an example of how the state is passed as props to the InputBox component:

javascript
Edit
Copy code
<InputBox
  label="From"
  amount={amount}
  currencyOptions={options}
  onCurrencyChange={(currency) => setFrom(currency)}
  selectCurrency={from}
  onAmountChange={(amount) => setAmount(amount)}
/>
By using a unified state management approach, the application can easily manage complex state changes and ensure that the state is consistent across all components.**
